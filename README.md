# Password-Generator
A Python application which will generate passwords for us.
# What I do in this Code ?
For this i use the string and random module. At first i am going to generate the characters using the string module, then going to use the random module to generate a password. We will also add a function which will give us the password for our desirable length and then your password save in "password.txt" file.
